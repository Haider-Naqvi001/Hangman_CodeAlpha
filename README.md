# Hangman_CodeAlpha
This simple console-based Hangman game was created during my internship at CodeAlpha. It features random word selection, real-time display of guesses, and user input validation with a countdown of attempts. The project helped me strengthen my Python skills and enhance my problem-solving abilities through interactive game design.
